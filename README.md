**World ID powered review app for authentic human written reviews and ratings**

Review is a review and discovery platform built as a Worldcoin Mini App that leverages World ID authentication to create a trusted review ecosystem. Users can search for products by name or scan barcodes (supporting ISBN, UPC, and EAN formats) to instantly access product information and read or write verified reviews.

Review solves the problem of fake reviews and review spam by requiring World ID verification for all review submissions, ensuring each review comes from a real, unique human. Users can discover products through text search or by scanning physical product barcodes using their phone's camera, making it easy to review items while shopping or at home.
