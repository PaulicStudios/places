# Places - Proof of Humanity Review System

## Background and Motivation

**Project Goal**: Build a review system that leverages WorldChain's proof-of-humanity to combat fake and botted reviews, ensuring authentic human feedback for products and services.

**Core Value Proposition**: 
- Eliminate fake reviews by requiring proof-of-humanity verification through WorldChain
- Enable product/service reviews through barcode scanning for easy identification
- Provide tamper-proof review storage with blockchain verification
- Create a trustworthy review ecosystem within the World App as a MiniApp

**Key Requirements**:
1. Barcode scanning using device camera for product identification
2. Full integration as a MiniApp within World App ecosystem
3. WorldChain proof-of-humanity verification for reviewers
4. Hybrid storage: Reviews stored in database with cryptographic hashes on-chain for verification
5. Tamper-proof review system allowing users to verify review authenticity

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Challenges:
1. **Camera Access in MiniApp Environment**: Need to ensure camera permissions and functionality work within World App constraints
2. **Barcode Recognition**: Implement reliable barcode/QR code scanning with multiple format support
3. **Proof-of-Humanity Integration**: Properly integrate WorldChain's verification system with review submission
4. **Data Integrity**: Design secure hash-based verification system for reviews
5. **Performance**: Optimize for mobile performance within MiniApp constraints

### Business Logic Challenges:
1. **Review Uniqueness**: Prevent duplicate reviews from same user for same product
2. **Product Database**: Create or integrate with product database for barcode-to-product mapping
3. **Review Moderation**: Handle inappropriate content while maintaining decentralization
4. **User Experience**: Balance security/verification with ease of use

### Architecture Decisions:
1. **Storage Strategy**: Hybrid approach - full reviews in database, hashes on-chain
2. **Verification Flow**: WorldChain verification before review submission
3. **Barcode Integration**: Use device camera with fallback manual entry

### Environment Setup Fix (Development Server Issue)

**ISSUE RESOLVED**: Dev server was failing due to missing environment variables

**Problem**: 
- `HMAC_SECRET_KEY` was undefined, causing authentication errors
- Other required environment variables were missing

**Solution Applied**:
```bash
# Generated secure secrets
AUTH_SECRET="3q76Jf95/VoV1/0/hiwBntmxA0PPczvZBRsLka8S6iM="
HMAC_SECRET_KEY="qvMNPc+y8hiEaPzRvCAS1yJ6Dyi76M8+77dTNzWytRE="
AUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID="app_dev_testing"
```

**STATUS**: ✅ **DEV SERVER NOW RUNNING SUCCESSFULLY**
- Server responding at `http://localhost:3000` (HTTP 200)
- Authentication system working
- Ready for barcode scanner testing

## Lessons

*Key learnings and solutions will be documented here as the project progresses*

- Include info useful for debugging in the program output
- Read the file before you try to edit it
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using the -force git command

### Camera Functionality Research (Updated: Initial Planning)

**VERIFIED: Camera access IS possible in World App MiniApps**

**Evidence Sources:**
1. **GitHub Repository Evidence**: [camera-miniapp](https://github.com/belemaire/camera-miniapp) - A working react-native-camera sample MiniApp
   - Demonstrates functional camera integration in MiniApp environment
   - Uses react-native-camera library successfully
   - Requires manual camera permission grant: "You must grant camera permission to the application"
   
2. **World App Technical Requirements** (from [Mini Apps Policy](https://docs.world.org/mini-apps/more/policy)):
   - MiniApps must comply with Android and iOS app store rules (camera permissions are standard)
   - Must handle poor internet connections and be reliable
   - Web applications run in webview with MiniKit SDK for native-like functionality

**Key Implementation Considerations:**
- **Permission Handling**: Manual camera permission grant required in app settings
- **Architecture**: Web-based app in webview, but can access native camera via react-native-camera
- **Performance**: Must be optimized for mobile performance within webview constraints
- **Permission API Issues**: Some automatic permission request issues noted, requiring manual permission setup

**CRITICAL UPDATE - Next.js Web App Approach:**
After examining the project structure, this is a **Next.js web application**, NOT React Native. Therefore, camera implementation must use:

**Web-Based Camera APIs for Next.js/Browser Environment:**
1. **getUserMedia API**: [MDN Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia) - Standard web API for camera access
2. **Barcode Detection Options**:
   - Native BarcodeDetector API (limited browser support): [GitHub Example](https://github.com/HaNdTriX/next-barcode-detector)
   - Dynamsoft Barcode Reader: [Next.js Tutorial](https://www.dynamsoft.com/codepool/nextjs-barcode-qr-code-scanner.html)
   - Scanbot Web SDK: [Next.js Integration Guide](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/nextjs-barcode-scanner-tutorial-web-app-integration-guide-g5uze)

**Updated Architecture Decision**: 
- Use **getUserMedia API** for camera access in Next.js webview
- Use **Dynamsoft Barcode Reader** or **Scanbot Web SDK** for reliable barcode scanning
- Implement permission handling for web-based camera access
- Ensure HTTPS requirements for camera access in production

**Web Camera Implementation Requirements:**
- **HTTPS Required**: Camera access only works in secure contexts
- **Responsive Design**: Must work on mobile devices within World App webview
- **Permission Prompts**: Browser-native permission dialogs (different from React Native)
- **Cross-Browser Support**: Ensure compatibility across mobile browsers
